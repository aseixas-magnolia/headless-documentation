# Content Types

Magnolia Content Types are similar to the content types concepts from other headless CMS. Some key differences are: They are defined in YAML files in a very slim format (with all of the benefits of [Light Development](light-development). They support hierarchies via nested folders. They define only the model. The generated UI, called a Content App, can be customized more deeply than any other CMS.
