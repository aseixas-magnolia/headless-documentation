# Management API

Magnolia's management APIs are very flexible. 


## Nodes API

With the Nodes API you write to the JCR system where Magnolia content and configuration are stored. This means you can configure any subsystem, and modify any content.

* See [Full Docs: Nodes API](https://documentation.magnolia-cms.com/display/DOCS/Nodes+endpoint+API)

## Commands API

Trigger any registered command in Magnolia via API. Use this to setup webhooks when other systems should trigger Magnolia.
You can create additional custom commands in Magnolia to perform literally any task or action.
