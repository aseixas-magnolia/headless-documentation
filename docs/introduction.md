## Why Magnolia?

Magnolia is the headless CMS that‚Äôs as great for content authors as it is for developers.

You‚Äôre probably choosing to go headless for a fast, productive and fun development experience and in order to have a tidy, decoupled and maintainable system.  ‚úîÔ∏è

But when you roll out your content authoring tool to your client, will they like it? Will they understand it? How much training will they need? Will they be able to manage everything themselves - not needing to come back to you on a regular basis for small changes?

Or will they silently curse you? üò±

Magnolia gives you the tools to empower content authors. (And make them happy! üòÉ)

*   __Content apps__ provide standard form-based content editing (as you know from every headless CMS.)
*   __Visual SPA Editor__ allows authors to work directly in the experience with a WYSIWYG "page builder".
*   __Trees__ Intrinsic support for hierarchies of content. Everyone understands trees.
*   __IUX__ (Integrated User Experience) allows you to surface content, information and controls from other systems directly into the Magnolia authoring experience, to give authors the tools they need right where and when they need it.
*   __Connectors and deep integration__ capabilities, it's the foundation of Magnolia, and what makes it so good for taking a Best of Breed approach.

## Headless docs / Full docs

This documentation site covers a subset of the product. The [full documentation](https://documentation.magnolia-cms.com) site covers everything in this deep product.
We decided to make this separate site so that frontend developers can get started right away, and not be overloaded with information that might not be relevant to them.
