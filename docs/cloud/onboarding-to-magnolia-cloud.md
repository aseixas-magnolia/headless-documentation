## Subscribing

Interested in using Magnolia for your cloud-based project? [Contact us for a demo](https://www.magnolia-cms.com/try.html) and let's get you started.

During the subscription process, we ask you to provide details about your project, such as:

* A short name for your company (limited to 7 lowercase characters), for example, *acmecrp.*
* The name of your project to be used as your subscription package name in the UI, for example, *Acme Corporation Website*.
* A short name for your project (limited to 7 lowercase characters), for example, *acmeweb.*
* Regions where your editors work.
* User accounts required (full name, email address, role, and at least one telephone number for notifications).
* [Domain names](cloud-domains-and-certificates).
* Planned integrations.
* The whitelist of IP addresses allowed access to your cloud package environments.
